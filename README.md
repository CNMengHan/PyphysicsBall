## üéÆ Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Implements gravity, elastic collisions, and momentum conservation
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Left-click to spawn or drag balls
  - Right-click to toggle force field (push/pull)
  - Double-click to clear an area
- **Special Effects**:
  - Golden balls that explode on impact
  - Ball merging with visual feedback
  - Dynamic color changes based on merges
- **Dynamic Spawning System**: Automatic ball generation with size variations

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
